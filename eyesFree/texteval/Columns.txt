The following are explanations for the aggregate measure columns that are 
produced by the StreamAnalyzer program. Numbers in brackets refer to the Bibliography.

Num 		The task number for this trial.
Testing? 	True/false. Whether this trial was testing or not.
Time 		The total time (in seconds) for this trial.

WPM 		The words per minute for this trial.
AdjWPM 		The adjusted words per minute: WPM * (1 - Uncorrected Error Rate)
CPS 		Characters per second. Equivalent to WPM.
KSPS 		Keystrokes per second, a measure of how fast characters are sent [5,6].
GPS 		Gestures per second, a measure of how fast gestures are made [5,6].

Intra		Average time within characters for this trial [5,6].
Inter 		Average time between characters for this trial [5,6].

StrDist 	The minimum string distance (MSD) between P and T [3].

MSD_v1 		The first MSD error rate defined in the literature [3].
MSD_v2 		The second MSD error rate defined in the literature [1].
MSD_v3 		The third MSD error rate defined in the literature [4].

KSPC_v1		The first keystrokes per character defined in the literature [3]. 
KSPC_v3 	The second KSPC defined. It accompanies the 3rd MSD defined [4].

GPC 		Gestures per character, a measure of efficiency [5,6].
GPKS 		Gestures per keystroke, a measure of verbosity [5,6].

UncErrRate 	Uncorrected error rate [4].
CorErrRate 	Corrected error rate [4].
TotErrRate 	Total error rate [4].

Effic 		Correction efficiency [4].
Consc 		Participant conscientiousness [4].
UtilBand 	Utilized bandwidth [4].
WasteBand 	Wasted bandwidth [4].

|C| 		The number of characters classified as "correct" [4].
|INF| 		The number of characters classified as "incorrect not fixed" [4].
|IF| 		The number of characters classified as "incorrect fixed" [4].
|F| 		The number of characters classified as "fixes" [4].

|P| 		The length of the presented string.
|T| 		The length of the transcribed string.
|IS| 		The length of the input stream, not counting non-recognitions.
|G| 		The length of the input stream counting non-recognitions (number of gestures).
|NR|		The number of non-recognitions in the input stream.
